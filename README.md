# grow-lamp

Arduino code for an energy efficient LED grow lamp that automatically activates and deactivates depending on the time of day.

This was built for a externally dimmable current regulating LED driver, specifically a [Luxeonstar 3023-D-E-700](http://www.luxeonstar.com/700ma-external-dimming-buckpuck-dc-driver-leaded).

I used a [Rebel Tri-Star CoolBase 705 lm](http://www.luxeonstar.com/cool-white-5650k-20mm-tri-star-coolbase-led-705lm) as the LED.

Currently you can only specify an on and off time which will dim the LED in/out at these times. Eventually you will be able to specify your location (lon/lat) to which it will calculate the sunrise / sunset times automatically.

Will link to a blog post shortly showing the actual setup / wiring.
